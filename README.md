**Predicting breast cancer subtypes using machine learning algorithms on arrayCGH data** 

*Abstract* \
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. Clinical outcome is highly variable and depends on the molecular profile of the tumour. Here we attempt to distinguish among the three tumour subtypes using four machine learning algorithms: k-nearest neighbours (kNN), random forests, decision tree and support vector machine (SVM). We aim to find the best performing model and the most important feature which can be used for biomarker discovery. The best performing model is a random forest, which reaches an average accuracy of 0.76. The single region that is the most important for the model is mapped to the genomic region Chr17: 35076296 - 35282086 which includes a gene for coding HER2. The results suggest that the three subtypes can be predicted with a high accuracy. The prediction result could contribute to our understanding of the subtypes in breast cancer and utilized in clinical settings for deciding suitable treatment and prognosis.
